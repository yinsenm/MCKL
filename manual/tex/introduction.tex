\section{Organization of Headers}
\label{sec:Organization of Headers}

\mckl is a header-only library. All headers files are under the |mckl|
directory. To include all functionalities,
\begin{verbatim}
#include <mckl/mckl.hpp>
\end{verbatim}
There are a few other headers that include a subset of functionalities of
\mckl, each documented in a subsequent chapter in this manual. They are listed
in table~\ref{tab:headers}. These headers does not define anything other than
including other headers that each implements a specific feature. If only a few
features are needed, then one can include only the header that implements those
features to save compilation time. For example,
\begin{verbatim}
#include <mckl/random/threefry.hpp>
\end{verbatim}
includes the header that implements \rng engines based on the Threefry
algorithm in~\cite{Salmon:2011um} (see section~\ref{sub:Threefry}). See the
reference manual\footnote{\url{http://zhouyan.github.io/MCKLDoc/master}} for
the header file of each class and function defined in \mckl.

\section{Optional Runtime Library}
\label{sec:Optional Runtime Library}

In addition to the header-only library, one can optionally build and use a
runtime library. To build the library, one need a recent version of the
\nasm\footnote{\url{http://www.nasm.us}} assembler and the
\cmake\footnote{\url{https://cmake.org}} program. The library is only supported
on x86-64 \cpu{}s and 64-bit \unix and compatible systems. To build and install
the library,
\begin{verbatim}
cd /path/to/mckl/source
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/prefix/to/install/directory
make lib
make install
\end{verbatim}
To use and link to the library in a user program, say |prog.cpp|,
\begin{verbatim}
c++ -DMCKL_USE_ASM_LIB=1 -o prog prog.cpp -lmckl
\end{verbatim}

The runtime library provides optimized implementation of selected vectorized
random number generators (section~\ref{sec:Vectorized Random Number Generating}
and~\ref{sec:Counter-Based Random Number Generators}). Performance of the
header-only implementation might vary considerably depending on the compiler.

Further, one can set the configuration macro |MCKL_USE_ASM_VMF| to use an
assembly implementation of selected vectorized math functions when \mkl \vml is
unavailable (section~\ref{sec:Vectorized Functions}). This feature is highly
experimental. These functions are fast, but have slightly lower accuracy for
some values of input than the standard library or \mkl \vml in high accuracy
mode.
