\section{Organization of headers}
\label{sec:Organization of headers}

\mckl is a header-only library. All headers files are under the |mckl|
directory. To include all functionalities,
\begin{verbatim}
#include <mckl/mckl.hpp>
\end{verbatim}
There are a few other headers that include a subset of functionalities of
\mckl, each documented in a subsequent chapter in this manual. They are listed
in table~\ref{tab:headers}. These headers does not define anything other than
including other headers that each implement a specific feature. If only one a
few features are needed, then one can include only headers that implement those
features to save compilation time. For example,
\begin{verbatim}
#include <mckl/random/threefry.hpp>
\end{verbatim}
includes only the header that implements \rng engines based on the Threefry
algorithm in~\cite{Salmon:2011um} (see section~\ref{sub:Threefry}). See the
reference manual\footnote{\url{http://zhouyan.github.io/MCKLDoc/master}} for
the header file for each class and function defined in \mckl.
