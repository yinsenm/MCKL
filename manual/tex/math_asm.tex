\chapter{Performance of common mathematical functions}
\label{chap:Performance of common mathematical functions}

\system

\compilerone

Three implementations are considered. The first is the one from the standard
library, the second is from the \vml library of \mkl, and the third is the
experimental \asm implementation in section~\ref{sec:Experimental Vectorized
Implementation}. They are labeled as ‘\std’, ‘\vml’ and ‘\asm’, respectively.
Each function's is measured on multiple numerical ranges. The value $\epsilon$
denote the smallest positive normal number in double precision.
