\chapter{Performance of distribution}
\label{chap:Performance of distribution}

The performance of distributions in sections~\ref{sec:Continuous distribution}
and~\ref{sec:Discrete distribution} are measured in single core cycles per
element (\cpe). The processor used is Intel Core i7-4960\textsc{hq}. The
operating system is Mac OS X (version~10.11.6). The compiler is \llvm clang
(version Apple~7.3.0). The \mkl library is used for vectorized mathematical
functions.

Four usage cases of the distributions are considered. First, if the
distribution is available in the standard library, we measure the following
case,
\begin{verbatim}
std::normal_distribution<double> rnorm_std(0, 1);
for (size_t i = 0; i = n; ++i)
    r[i] = rand(rng, rnorm_std);
\end{verbatim}
Second, we measure the performance of the library's implementation,
\begin{verbatim}
NormalDistribution<double> rnorm_mckl(0, 1);
for (size_t i = 0; i = n; ++i)
    r[i] = rand(rng, rnorm_mckl);
\end{verbatim}
The third is the vectorized performance,
\begin{verbatim}
rand(rng, rnorm_mckl, n, r.data());
\end{verbatim}
For all the three above, the \rng is |ARSx8| (section~\ref{sub:AES-NI
instructions based RNG}). The last is when there are \mkl routines for
generating random variates from the distribution directly (e.g., Normal
distribution) or indirectly (e.g., Student's $t$-distribution). In this case,
we use the \rng |MKL_SFMT19937| (see section~\ref{sec:MKL RNG}),
\begin{verbatim}
MKL_SFMT19937 rng_mkl;
rand(rng_mkl, rnorm_mckl, n, r.data());
\end{verbatim}
In all cases, we repeat the simulations 100 times, each time with the number of
elements $n$ chosen randomly between 5,000 and 10,000. The total number of
cycles of the 100 simulations are recorded, and then divided by the total
number of elements generated. This gives the performance measurement in \cpe.
This experiment is repeated ten times, and the best results are shown. The four
cases are labeled ``\std'', ``\mckl'', ``\textsc{batch}'' and ``\mkl'',
respectively, in tables below.
