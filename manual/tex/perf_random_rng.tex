\chapter{Performance of RNG}
\label{chap:Performance of RNG}

The performance of \rng{}s in sections~\ref{sec:Counter-based RNG}
to~\ref{sec:Non-deterministic RNG} are measured in single core cycles per byte
(\cpb). The processor used is Intel Core i7-4960\textsc{hq}. The operating
system is Mac OS X (version~10.11.6).

Three compilers are tested. The \llvm clang (version Apple~7.3.0), the \gnu
\gcc (version~6.2.0) and the Intel \cpp compiler (version~17.0.0). They are
labeled ``\llvm'', ``\gnu'', and ``\textsc{intel}'', respectively, in tables
below.

Two usage cases of \rng{}s are considered. The first is generating random
integers within a loop,
\begin{verbatim}
UniformBitsDistribution<uint64_t> ubits;
for (std:size_t i = 0; i != n; ++i)
    r[i] = rand(rng, ubits);
\end{verbatim}
The second is the vectorized performance,
\begin{verbatim}
rand(rng, ubits, n, r.data());
\end{verbatim}
In both cases, we repeat the simulations 100 times, each time with the number
of elements $n$ chosen randomly between 5,000 and 10,000. The total number of
cycles of the 100 simulations are recorded, and then divided by the total
number of bytes generated. This gives the performance measurement in \cpb. This
experiment is repeated ten times, and the best results are shown. The two cases
are labeled ``\textsc{loop}'' and ``\textsc{batch}'', respectively, in the
tables below.
