Two usage cases of \rng{}s are considered. The first is generating random
integers within a loop, each iteration generate a single random integer,
\begin{verbatim}
RNGType rng;
UniformBitsDistribution<typename RNGType::result_type> ubits;
for (std:size_t i = 0; i != n; ++i)
    r[i] = rand(rng, ubits);
\end{verbatim}
For \rng{}s that output random integers uniform on the set $\Curly{0,\dots,2^W
  - 1}$, where $W$ is the number of bits in its output integer type, this is
equivalent to
\begin{verbatim}
for (std::size_t i = 0; i != n; ++i)
    r[i] = rng();
\end{verbatim}
The second is the vectorized performance,
\begin{verbatim}
rand(rng, ubits, n, r.data());
\end{verbatim}
For \rng{}s that output random integers uniform on the set $\Curly{0,\dots,2^W
  - 1}$, where $W$ is the number of bits in its output integer type, this is
equivalent to
\begin{verbatim}
rand(rng, n, r.data());
\end{verbatim}
See section~\ref{sec:Vectorized random number generating}. In both cases, we
repeat the simulations 100 times, each time with the number of elements $n$
chosen randomly between 5,000 and 10,000. The total number of cycles of the 100
simulations are recorded, and then divided by the total number of bytes
generated. This gives the performance measurement in \cpb. This experiment is
repeated ten times, and the best results are shown. The two cases are labeled
``\single'' and ``\batch'', respectively, in the tables below.
