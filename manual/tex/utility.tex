\section{Aligned memory allocation}
\label{sec:Aligned memory allocation}

The standard library class |std::allocator| is used by containers to allocate
memory. It works fine in most cases. However, sometime it is desirable to
allocate memory aligned by a certain boundary. The library provides the class
template,
\begin{verbatim}
template <typename T, size_t Alignment = AlignmentTrait<T>::value,
    typename Memory = AlignedMemory>
class Allocator;
\end{verbatim}
which conforms to the |std::allocator| interface. The address of the pointer
returned by the |allocate| method is a multiple of |Alignment|. The value of
alignment has to be positive, larger than |sizeof(void *)|, and a power of two.
The last template parameter |Memory| shall have two static methods,
\begin{verbatim}
static void *aligned_malloc(size_t n, size_t alignment);
static void aligned_free(void *ptr);
\end{verbatim}
The method |aligned_malloc| shall behave similar to |std::malloc| with the
additional alignment requirement. It shall return a null pointer if it fails to
allocate memory. It may or may not raise an exception in this situation. In any
other case, including zero input size, it shall return a pointer to a reachable
address. The method |aligned_free| shall behave similar to |std::free|. It
shall be able to handle a null pointer as its input. The library provides three
implementations, discussed below. The default argument |AlignedMemory| is an
alias to one of them by default. It can be changed by defining the
configuration macro |MCKL_ALIGNED_MEMORY_TYPE|.

The |AlignedMemoryTBB| class uses the functions from the \tbb library. This is
the default method if |MCKL_USE_TBB_MALLOC| is true. The |AlignedMemorySYS|
class uses operating system specific functions. Last, the |AlignedMemorySTD|
class uses functions in the standard library and pads the memory manually when
the alignment is insufficient. It is the last resort method that the library
uses when operating system support for aligned memory allocation cannot be
used.

The default alignment depends on the type |T|. If it is a scalar type, then the
alignment is |MCKL_ALIGNMENT|, whose default is 32. This alignment is
sufficient for modern \simd operations, such as \avx. For other types, the
alignment is |MCKL_ALIGNMENT_MIN|, whose default is 16, unless the natural
alignment of the type |T|, |alignof(T)|, is larger. A container type is
defined for convenience, as a drop-in replacement for |std::vector|. It is
merely a type alias with a different default allocator,
\begin{verbatim}
template <typename T>
using Vector = std::vector<T, Allocator<T>>;
\end{verbatim}
Any function template that accepts |std::vector| also accepts this class, as
long as the template is defined correctly. For example,
\begin{verbatim}
template <typename T, typename Alloc>
void func(std::vector<T, Alloc> &vec);
\end{verbatim}

\section{Sample covariance}
\label{sec:Sample covariance}

The library provides the class template
\begin{verbatim}
template <typename RealType = double>
class Covariance;
\end{verbatim}
to estimate the sample covariance $\Sigma$, for samples $x\in\Real^p$, $p\ge1$,
\begin{align*}
  \Sigma_{i,j} &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i}
  {(\sum_{i=1}^N w_i)^2 - \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2}
  \sum_{k=1}^N w_k (x_{k,i} - \bar{x}_i)(x_{k,j} - \bar{x}_j) \\
  \bar{x}_i &= \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i}\sum_{k=1}^N w_k x_{k,i}
\end{align*}
where $x_{i,j}$ is the $j$th component of the $i$th sample, and $w_i$ is the
weight of the $i$th sample. At the time of writing, only |float| and |double|
are supported. The class has the following operator as its interface,
\begin{verbatim}
void operator()(MatrixLayout layout, size_t n, size_t p, const RealType *x,
    const RealType *w, RealType *mean, RealType *cov,
    MatrixLayout cov_layout = RowMajor, bool cov_upper = false,
    bool cov_packed = false);
\end{verbatim}
It computes the sample covariance matrix $\Sigma$,
where $x$ is the $n$ by $p$ matrix of samples, and $w$ is the $n$-vector of
weights. Below we give description of each parameter,
\begin{description}
  \item[\texttt{layout}] The storage layout of sample matrix $x$.
  \item[\texttt{n}] The number of samples.
  \item[\texttt{p}] The dimension of samples.
  \item[\texttt{x}] The sample matrix. If it is a null pointer, then no
    computation is done.
  \item[\texttt{w}] The weight vector. If it is a null pointer, then $w_i = 1$
    for $i = 1,\dots,n$.
  \item[\texttt{mean}] Output storage of the mean vector. If it is a null
    pointer, then it is ignored.
  \item[\texttt{cov}] Output storage of the covariance matrix. If it is a null
    pointer, then it is ignored.
  \item[\texttt{cov\_layout}] The storage layout of the covariance matrix.
  \item[\texttt{cov\_upper}] If true, then the upper triangular of the
    covariance matrix is packed. Otherwise the lower triangular is packed. It
    is ignored if |cov_pack| is false.
  \item[\texttt{cov\_packed}] If true, then the covariance matrix is
    packed.
\end{description}
The last three parameters specify the storage scheme of the covariance matrix.
See any reference of \blas or \lapack for explanation of the scheme. Below is
an example of the class in use,
\begin{verbatim}
using T = StateMatrix<RowMajor, p, double>;
Sampler<T> sampler(n);
// Configure and iterate the sampler
double mean[p];
double cov[p * (p + 1) / 2];
Covariance eval;
auto x = sampler.particle().state().data();
auto w = sampler.particle().weight().data();
eval(RowMajor, n, p, x, w, mean, cov, RowMajor, false, true);
\end{verbatim}
One can later compute the Cholesky decomposition using \lapack or other linear
algebra libraries. Below is an example of using the covariance matrix to
generate multivariate Normal random numbers,
\begin{verbatim}
double chol[p * (p + 1) / 2];
double y[p];
LAPACKE_dpptrf(LAPACK_ROW_MAJOR, 'L', p, chol);
NormalMVDistribution<double, p> normal_mv(mean, chol);
normal_mv(rng, y);
\end{verbatim}

\section{Store objects in \texorpdfstring{\hdf}{HDF5} format}
\label{sec:Store objects in HDF5 format}

If the \hdf library is available (|MCKL_HAS_HDF5|), it is possible to store
|Sampler| objects, etc., in the \hdf format. For example,
\begin{verbatim}
hdf5store(sampler, "pf.h5", "sampler", false);
\end{verbatim}
creates an \hdf file named |pf.h5| with the sampler stored as a list in the
group |sampler|. If the last argument is |true|, the data is inserted to an
existing file. Otherwise a new file is created. In R it can be processed as the
following,
\begin{verbatim}
library(rhdf5)
pf <- as.data.frame(h5read("pf.h5", "sampler"))
\end{verbatim}
This creates a |data.frame|. The |hdf5store| function is overloaded for
|StateMatrix|, |Sampler| and |Monitor|. It is also overloaded for |Particle| if
an overload for |T| is defined. They all follow the format as above. In
addition, the following creates a new empty \hdf file,
\begin{verbatim}
hdf5store(filename);
\end{verbatim}
and the following creates a new group named |dataname|,
\begin{verbatim}
hdf5store(filename, dataname, append);
\end{verbatim}

\section{Stop watch}
\label{sec:Stop watch}

Performance can only be improved after it is first properly profiled. There are
advanced profiling programs for this purpose. However, sometime simple timing
facilities are enough. The library provides a simple class |StopWatch| for this
purpose. As its name suggests, it works much like a physical stop watch. Here
is a simple example
\begin{verbatim}
StopWatch watch;
for (int i = 0; i != n; ++i) {
    watch.start(); // Some computation
    // Computation to be benchmarked;
    watch.stop();  // Some other computation
}
double t = watch.seconds(); // The time in seconds
\end{verbatim}
The above example demonstrate that timing can be accumulated between loop
iterations, function calls, etc. It shall be noted that, the timing is only
useful if the computation between |start| and |stop| is non-trivial.
